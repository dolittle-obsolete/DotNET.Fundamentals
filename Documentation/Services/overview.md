In our fundamentals, you'll find a package called [Services](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dolittle.Services/).
The purpose of this package is to make it possible to provide hosted services that leverages
[gRPC](https://grpc.github.io) to create an API surface.

It is built on top of the official [C# gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/csharp/) support, with
a reliable wrapper on top and providing an abstraction that is discoverable and extensible for you to
provide hosts.
